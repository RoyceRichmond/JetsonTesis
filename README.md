gpsoled_exception is the latest commit, this program runs and avoids the value error and type error.
an external trigger for the execution of the program is needed and add the camera, so the program can take pictures and save the GPS coordinates
camera should be an easy fix, it still needs field test for the GPS

plotting plots some values and prints the total distance traveled in meters.

gpsoled_exception and plotting are the files that can be used
